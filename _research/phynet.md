Real-world PHY datasets are typically limited to RF fingerprinting for a single protocol. PHYNet labels transmissions in over-the-air captures using hardware sniffers for Wi-Fi, BLE, Zigbee, LoRa, and 5G alongside GNU Radio transmitters. Hardware timestamps and clock-drift correction align labels to within approximately 2 µs of the IQ samples, and a successive decoding and cancellation pipeline recovers weaker transmissions. The labels support benchmarking of energy detection, modulation recognition, RF fingerprinting, and source identification, and were used to study how little current spectrum-awareness tools capture of real spectrum activity.
