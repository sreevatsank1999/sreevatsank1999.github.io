RoboNEST is an end-to-end testbed that brings real robots, interchangeable access networks, and edge GPUs into one instrumented platform, making the complete sensing-to-action path of a Physical AI task observable and controllable. Two xArm7 arms, SO-101 leader-follower arms, and a TurtleBot stream camera, LiDAR, depth, and IMU data to the edge over Ethernet, Wi-Fi 6, or a private 5G network running [EdgeRIC](https://edgeric.ucsd.edu/). Vision-language-action (VLA) policies run there on GPUs ranging from A10s to an RTX 6000 and a GB10. Clock-synchronized logging correlates application events with RAN state, modem diagnostics, and GPU inference. On a 1080p manipulation task over 5G, moving the policy from an A10 to an RTX 6000 reduces glass-to-action latency from 179 ms to 111 ms; on the same GPU, Wi-Fi and Ethernet reach 77 ms and 68 ms.
